## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate consultant and developer focused on creating impactful, human-centric solutions that foster collaboration, growth, and sustainability. With a background in technology and strategic consulting, I've worked on a variety of projects, from building web applications to implementing enterprise systems. 

Iâ€™m currently building **Language Coach**, a language coach app that connects learners with mentors to enhance language acquisition through real-time practice. My experience also spans across HR system implementations and other enterprise solutions, driving long-term improvements for businesses.
